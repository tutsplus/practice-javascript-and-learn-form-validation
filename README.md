# [Practice JavaScript and Learn: Form Validation][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]

JavaScript was created for validating forms because it allowed for a better user experience by validating the form before it was submitted to the server. Interestingly, form validation remained largely unchanged until HTML5. Validating forms used to be a tedious and mundane process, but thanks to these new features in HTML5, we can write validation code much more easily. We can now take advantage of the built-in Constraint Validation API to provide a clean user experience without having to write a lot of code.

In this course, Jeremy McPeak will show you how to use JavaScript and the HTML5 Constraint Validation functionality to ensure user data in forms is entered correctly. We'll code a simple form from start to finish, adding validation at each step.
